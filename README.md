# Overview
This repository contains reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software system design. 

The following patterns are covered:
- Adapter (Wraps incompatible interfaces to work together);
- Factory (Creates objects without exposing instantiation logic);
- Observer (Notifies subscribed objects when state changes);
- Singleton (Ensures only one instance of a class exists).
